# GSERM Course - Deep Learning: Fundamentals and Applications

This repository features a series of interactive Jupyter Notebooks for the Summer 2021 lab course accompanying the 
GSERM *Deep Learning: Fundamentals and Applications* course, taught by **Prof. Dr. Damian Borth** and **Prof. Dr. Korbinian Riedhammer** at the University of St. Gallen (HSG).

The goal of this lab course is to teach some basics in Python programming, machine learning and artificial 
neural networks.

This is currently work in progress so expect minor errors and some rough edges ;)

Happy coding,

Your GSERM teaching team

## How To Run the Lab Notebooks

You can run the lab Notebooks in the cloud using [binder](https://mybinder.org/) or 
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

#### Binder

This is the easiest way to run a Notebook in your web browser: just click on the binder badge next to 
the Notebooks below and off you go. Binder is a service that lets you run Jupyter Notebooks in their cloud at no charge. 
There is no registration and no
login required. However, keep in mind that you cannot save any data or your Notebook file in the cloud (you can save them
on your computer, though). Also, starting a binder
Notebook can take quite some time, but the performance during runtime is good. 
For more information, please refer to the [Binder documentation](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

#### Google Colab

Similar to binder, you just have to click the Colab badge next to the Notebooks below. All you need is a Google login
(e.g., your login information for gmail) and you can use this service at no charge. 
Two advantages of Colab are that (1) you can save your 
Notebooks directly into your Google Drive and read data from there, and (2) Google provides you with some limited GPU capabilities
free of charge (this will be an interesting feature for the coding challenge.)

If you need help running Python and/or Jupyter Notebooks, please don't hesitate to contact us (see below)!
